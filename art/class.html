			<div class="cards">
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Personal Playing Card</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/personalplayingcard.jpg" alt="Personal playing card illustration with decorative line work">
					</figure>
					<p>My own playing card design with a Greek pillar in the center, vines wrapping around it, and eyes floating in the air. I focused on clean lines and keeping the details balanced.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Line Landscape Drawing</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/linelandscape.jpg" alt="Pen line landscape drawing of a beach scene with palm trees">
					</figure>
					<p>A beach scene done only with lines and dots. I used thicker lines for the palm trunks and tighter line textures in the sand and water to show depth.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Linear Sculpture</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/linearsculpture.jpg" alt="White linear sculpture built from connected rods">
					</figure>
					<p>A 3D sculpture built from pyramid shapes connected together. The angles shift as it moves across the base, and keeping it stable was the hardest part.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Pencil / Colored Pencil Shattered Drawing</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/shattereddrawing.jpg" alt="Shattered geometric drawing shaded with graphite">
					</figure>
					<p>A shattered-style drawing of an old PC, built mostly from triangles. I blended graphite to get smooth value shifts and kept the edges sharp.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Color Wheel</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/colorwheel.jpg" alt="Painted color wheel showing primary, secondary, and tertiary colors">
					</figure>
					<p>A hand-painted color wheel with smooth transitions between each color slice. A few brush strokes show through, so it has a slightly rough texture.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Color Scheme Watercolor Painting</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/watercolorpainting.jpg" alt="Watercolor color scheme painting with geometric shapes">
					</figure>
					<p>A watercolor piece built around a C# logo, repeated in different color schemes. I tried to keep the washes even and the borders between shapes clean.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Scratchboard Animal</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/scratchboard.jpg" alt="Scratchboard animal drawing of a panda">
					</figure>
					<p>A scratchboard cat with lots of short scratch marks to build fur texture. The bright highlights around the face and paws were my favorite part.</p>

				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Sweat Solder</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_sweatsolder.jpg" alt="Small metal cup from the sweat solder project">
					</figure>
					<p>My first solder project. I focused on getting a clean join and cutting out shapes. This one was inspired by Bioshock.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Jump Rings</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_jumprings.jpg" alt="Three brass jump rings for solder practice">
					</figure>
					<p>Three brass rings. This was practice for ring soldering, and the seams turned out clean, almost undetectable.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Leaves and Flowers</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_leaves.jpg" alt="Metal leaf and flower forms with textured surfaces">
					</figure>
					<p>My least favorite. The leaves and flowers look a bit rough, and the texture didn’t come out as clean as I wanted, but again I didn't use my time too wisely.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Domed Ring</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_dome.jpg" alt="Domed metal ring with a slightly rough finish">
					</figure>
					<p>A domed ring that came out with good roundness. The finish is a bit rough, but the shape turned out okay. This was to practice rings.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Signature Ring</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_sigring.jpg" alt="Intertwined brass, copper, and silver ring">
					</figure>
					<p>Intertwined brass, copper, and silver rings. I made two, and this is the one that turned out really clean. Unironically I made this one before I made the domed ring.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Tab Setting</h3>
