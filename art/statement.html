			<h2>Fundamentals of Art</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Coming into Fundamentals of Art, I had some casual drawing experience and liked experimenting with color, but I hadn’t taken a class that pushed both 2D and 3D skills. I expected to learn the basics of line, value, and color, and I was a little concerned about keeping up with deadlines and using new materials correctly. My main goal was to build stronger foundations and develop more confidence in my work.</p>
			<h3>Favorite Project Reflection · Scratchboard Animal</h3>
			<p>My favorite project was the scratchboard animal. I chose a panda and focused on texture and strong contrast. I liked how the marks could create fur and movement, and I enjoyed the slow, careful process of revealing light. The biggest challenge was that mistakes are permanent, so I had to plan each area before scratching. If I did it again, I would test more mark types on a practice board first. The final piece turned out better than I expected and taught me patience, planning, and how to use contrast to make a subject stand out.</p>
			<h3>Least Favorite Project Reflection · Shattered Drawing</h3>
			<p>My least favorite project was the shattered drawing. It required precise geometry and smooth value shifts, which I found difficult to keep consistent. The planning phase felt slow, and I struggled to maintain clean edges while shading. If I revisited it, I would create a clearer value scale and map the light source more carefully before shading. While it didn’t turn out exactly as I hoped, it taught me how important structure and value control are for creating depth.</p>
			<h3>Growth Reflection</h3>
			<p>From the beginning of the semester, I’ve improved my ability to control value, mix color, and plan a composition. Breaking projects into steps helped me persist through frustrating moments, especially in media like watercolor and scratchboard. My confidence increased as I saw progress across different materials, and I found success in projects that required strong contrast and line work. I still want to improve my patience with long shading processes and refine my precision. The planning, critique, and revision habits I learned in this course will help me in other classes and any long-term projects.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Overall, Fundamentals of Art was a positive experience that built my foundation in both technique and mindset. My main takeaways are to plan ahead, trust the process, and use mistakes as opportunities to learn. For future students, I’d recommend starting projects early, keeping reference notes, and not being afraid to try new tools.</p>
