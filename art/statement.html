			<h2>Fundamentals of Art</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Coming into Fundamentals of Art, I had some casual drawing experience and liked experimenting with color, but I hadn’t taken a class that used both 2D and 3D skills. I expected to learn the basics of lines, values, and colors, and I was a little concerned about keeping up with deadlines and using new materials correctly. My goals were to build stronger foundations, improve how I plan projects, and develop more confidence in my work.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Beginning) · Contour Line Study</h3>
			<p>One of the first projects was a contour line study. I liked how it trained me to slow down and really observe shapes and edges instead of guessing. The challenge was keeping the lines purposeful without overworking the drawing. If I did it again, I would spend more time on warm-up sketches and focus on fewer, cleaner lines. It didn’t look perfect, but it helped me build observational skills that carried into later projects.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Middle) · Shattered Drawing</h3>
			<p>The shattered drawing came in the middle of the semester and required precise, smooth value shifts. The planning phase felt slow, and I struggled to maintain clean edges while shading. If I revisited it, I would create a clearer value scale and map the light source more carefully before shading. While it didn’t turn out exactly as I hoped, it taught me how important structure and value control are for creating depth.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (End) · Scratchboard Animal</h3>
			<p>Near the end of the semester, the scratchboard animal pushed my patience and decision-making. I chose a cat and focused on texture and strong contrast. I liked how the marks could create fur and movement, and I enjoyed the process of revealing light. The biggest challenge was that mistakes are permanent, so I had to plan each area before scratching. If I did it again, I would test more mark types on a practice board first. The final piece turned out better than I expected and taught me how to use contrast to make a subject stand out.</p>
			<h3>Growth Reflection &amp; Conclusion</h3>
			<p>From the beginning of the semester, I’ve improved my ability to control value, mix color, and plan an artwork. Breaking projects into steps helped me persist through frustrating components of the media, especially in watercolor and scratchboard. My confidence increased as I saw progress across different materials, and I found success in projects that required strong contrast and line work. I still want to improve my patience with long shading processes and refine my precision. The habits I learned in this course will help me in other classes and any long-term projects, and they connect back to my goal of building stronger foundations and planning more intentionally. Overall, Fundamentals of Art was a positive experience that built my foundation in both technique and mindset. My main takeaways are to plan ahead, trust the process, and use mistakes as opportunities to learn. For future students, I’d recommend starting projects early, keeping reference notes, and not being afraid to try new tools.</p>
