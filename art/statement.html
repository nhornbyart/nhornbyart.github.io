			<h2>Fundamentals of Art</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Coming into Fundamentals of Art, I had some casual drawing experience and liked experimenting with color, but I hadn’t taken a class that used both 2D and 3D skills. I expected to learn the basics of lines, values, and colors, and I was a little concerned about keeping up with deadlines and using new materials correctly. My goals were to build stronger foundations, improve how I plan projects, and develop more confidence in my work.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Beginning) · Personal Playing Card</h3>
			<p>One of the first projects was the personal playing card. I liked that it combined drawing, design, and a bit of storytelling (if you can truly understand it :) ). The challenge was balancing details with clear lines so it still read like a playing card and not a pure drawing. If I did it again, I would de-clutter the layouts before committing to the final design since it's very compact right now. It didn’t turn out exactly as I imagined, but it helped me practice planning early in the semester.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Middle) · Shattered Drawing</h3>
			<p>The shattered drawing came in the middle of the semester and required precise, smooth value shifts. The planning phase felt slow, and I struggled to maintain clean edges while shading. If I revisited it, I would create a clearer value scale and map the light source more carefully before shading. While it didn’t turn out exactly as I hoped, it taught me how important structure and value control are for creating depth.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (End) · Scratchboard Animal</h3>
			<p>Near the end of the semester, the scratchboard animal pushed my patience and decision-making. I chose a cat and focused on texture and strong contrast. I liked how the marks could create fur and movement, and I enjoyed the process of revealing light. The biggest challenge was that mistakes are permanent, so I had to plan each area before scratching. If I did it again, I would test more mark types on a practice board first. The final piece turned out better than I expected and taught me how to use contrast to make a subject stand out.</p>
			<h3>Growth Reflection &amp; Conclusion</h3>
			<p>From the beginning of the semester, I’ve improved my ability to control value, mix color, and plan an artwork. Breaking projects into steps helped me persist through frustrating components of the media, especially in watercolor and scratchboard. My confidence increased as I saw progress across different materials, and I found success in projects that required strong contrast and line work. I still want to improve my patience with long shading processes and refine my precision. The habits I learned in this course will help me in other classes and any long-term projects, and they connect back to my goal of building stronger foundations and planning more intentionally. Overall, Fundamentals of Art was a positive experience that built my foundation in both technique and mindset. My main takeaways are to plan ahead, trust the process, and use mistakes as opportunities to learn. For future students, I’d recommend starting projects early, keeping reference notes, and not being afraid to try new tools.</p>

			<h2>Metalsmithing and Jewelry Design 1</h2>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Going into Metalsmithing and Jewelry Design 1, I had zero experience with soldering or making jewelry. I was excited to work with metal but also nervous about tools since I've never made anything with metal before. My goal was to learn the basics and build pieces that actually looked finished.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Beginning) · Sweat Solder</h3>
			<p>The beginning project was sweat solder. It was my first time soldering, so the main goal was just getting a clean solder and a simple form. It wasn’t perfect, but it helped me learn how heat and solder flow work.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (Middle) · Leaves and Flowers</h3>
			<p>In the middle of the semester, I made the leaves and flowers piece. It ended up being my least favorite because the forms look rough and the texture didn’t come out how I wanted. It felt harder to control the shapes compared to the ring projects. If I redid it, I’d use my time more wisely so the final forms would be cleaner.</p>
			<h3>Project Reflection (End) · Signature Ring</h3>
			<p>Near the end, the signature ring was my favorite. It uses intertwined brass, copper, and silver, and I made two of them. I liked how the metals twist together and catch light differently. The hard part was keeping everything aligned while shaping, but the final result felt clean and wearable. If I did it again, I’d spend a little more time polishing so the surfaces are even smoother.</p>
			<h3>Growth Reflection</h3>
			<p>I improved a lot from the first solder project to the rings. At the start, I was just trying to make a clean solder, but later I could focus on shape and finishing. What helped me most was taking my time and checking each step before moving on. My confidence went up once my jump rings and signature ring came out solid, and I realized I could fix mistakes with buffing and polishing. I still want to improve my finishing so the surfaces look more professional, but I’m way more comfortable with the tools now.</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Overall, this class taught me patience and problem solving with materials I’d never used before. My main takeaway is that good results come from careful prep and good time usage. For future students, I’d say don’t rush the early steps and keep practicing on small pieces because it pays off later.</p>
