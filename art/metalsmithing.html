					<h3>Sweat Solder</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_sweatsolder.jpg" alt="Small metal cup from the sweat solder project">
					</figure>
					<p>My first solder project. I focused on getting a clean join and cutting out shapes. This one was inspired by Bioshock.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Jump Rings</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_jumprings.jpg" alt="Three brass jump rings for solder practice">
					</figure>
					<p>Three brass rings. This was practice for ring soldering, and the seams turned out clean, almost undetectable.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Leaves and Flowers</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_leaves.jpg" alt="Metal leaf and flower forms with textured surfaces">
					</figure>
					<p>My least favorite. The leaves and flowers look a bit rough, and the texture didn’t come out as clean as I wanted, but again I didn't use my time too wisely.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Domed Ring</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_dome.jpg" alt="Domed metal ring with a slightly rough finish">
					</figure>
					<p>A domed ring that came out with good roundness. The finish is a bit rough, but the shape turned out okay. This was to practice rings.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Signature Ring</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/m_sigring.jpg" alt="Intertwined brass, copper, and silver ring">
					</figure>
					<p>Intertwined brass, copper, and silver rings. I made two, and this is the one that turned out really clean. Unironically I made this one before I made the domed ring.</p>
