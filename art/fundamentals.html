			<div class="cards">
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Personal Playing Card</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/personalplayingcard.jpg" alt="Personal playing card illustration with decorative line work">
					</figure>
					<p>My own playing card design with a Greek pillar in the center, vines wrapping around it, and eyes floating in the air. I focused on clean lines and keeping the details balanced.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Line Landscape Drawing</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/linelandscape.jpg" alt="Pen line landscape drawing of a beach scene with palm trees">
					</figure>
					<p>A beach scene done only with lines and dots. I used thicker lines for the palm trunks and tighter line textures in the sand and water to show depth.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Linear Sculpture</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/linearsculpture.jpg" alt="White linear sculpture built from connected rods">
					</figure>
					<p>A 3D sculpture built from pyramid shapes connected together. The angles shift as it moves across the base, and keeping it stable was the hardest part.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Pencil / Colored Pencil Shattered Drawing</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/shattereddrawing.jpg" alt="Shattered geometric drawing shaded with graphite">
					</figure>
					<p>A shattered-style drawing of an old PC, built mostly from triangles. I blended graphite to get smooth value shifts and kept the edges sharp.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Color Wheel</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/colorwheel.jpg" alt="Painted color wheel showing primary, secondary, and tertiary colors">
					</figure>
					<p>A hand-painted color wheel with smooth transitions between each color slice. A few brush strokes show through, so it has a slightly rough texture.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Color Scheme Watercolor Painting</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/watercolorpainting.jpg" alt="Watercolor color scheme painting with geometric shapes">
					</figure>
					<p>A watercolor piece built around a C# logo, repeated in different color schemes. I tried to keep the washes even and the borders between shapes clean.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card project">
					<h3>Scratchboard Animal</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="/art/artwork/scratchboard.jpg" alt="Scratchboard animal drawing of a cat">
					</figure>
					<p>A scratchboard cat with lots of short scratch marks to build fur texture. The bright highlights around the face and paws were my favorite part.</p>
